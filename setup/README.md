# GitHub Action: Setup

This action performs setup of many common tools all at once. Please see the individual actions for more information.

* [checkout](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout>)
* [ssh-agent](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webfactory-ssh-agent>)
* [configure-aws-credentials](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-action-for-github-actions>)
* [setup-php](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-php-action>)
* [setup-python](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-python>)
* [setup-ruby](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-ruby-jruby-and-truffleruby>)
* [setup-xcode](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-xcode-version>)
* [setup-opensearch](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-opensearch>)
* [setup-mongodb](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mongodb-in-github-actions>)
* [setup-mysql](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/actions-setup-mysql>)
* [setup-rabbitmq](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rabbitmq-in-github-actions>)
* [setup-redis](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/actions-setup-redis>)

Take note that when you enable the setup action for a language, the corresponding [cache](<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache>) action(s) will also be automatically enabled.

## Auto-detection of Language Versions

This action automatically detects language version files in your repository and installs the corresponding languages without requiring explicit version inputs:

| Language | Version File              |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Go       | `.go-version`             |
| Java     | `.java-version`           |
| Node     | `.nvmrc`, `.node-version` |
| PHP      | `.php-version`            |
| Python   | `.python-version`         |
| Ruby     | `.ruby-version`           |

If a version file is present, the language will be installed using the version specified in the file. Explicit version inputs (e.g.,
`ruby-version: '3.2'`) will override auto-detection.

## Inputs

`setup` is a single composite action that orchestrates 124 inputs across many tools. Pass only the inputs for the tools you need; everything else is skipped. Inputs are grouped by tool below.

### Core

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `github-token` | no | `${{ github.token }}` | github token |
| `fetch-depth` | no | `1` | Number of commits to fetch. 0 indicates all history for all branches and tags. |
| `ssh-key` | no | — | ssh key |
| `persist-credentials` | no | `'false'` | Leave the token in `.git/config` after checkout so later steps can run authenticated git commands against `origin`. Off by default so the credential is not readable by every subsequent step; private submodules resolve over the SSH agent started from `ssh-key` and do not need it. |

### Languages & toolchains

#### Go

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `go-version` | no | `none` | The Go version to download (if necessary) and use. Supports semver spec and ranges. Be sure to enclose this option in single quotation marks. |
| `go-version-file` | no | — | Path to the go.mod or go.work file. |
| `go-check-latest` | no | `False` | Set this option to true if you want the action to always check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec |
| `go-token` | no | `${{ github.server_url == '<https://github.com'> && github.token \|\| '' }}` | Used to pull Go distributions from go-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting. |
